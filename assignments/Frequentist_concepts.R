#BINOMIAL
#What is the probability of observing a count of exactly 3 
#successes in a binomial distribution with parameters n = 4 and p = 0.75?
#dbinom(x, size=n, prob=p)
dbinom(3, size = 4, prob = 0.75)
#observing a count of 3 successes or fewer

1 - pbinom(3,size=5,0.75)
#NORMAL
#a value of less than 1.2 from a normally-distributed population with mean = 2 and standard deviation = 2
